/*
TM1650.cpp - Library implementation for TM1650.

Part of the TM16xx library by Maxint. See https://github.com/maxint-rd/TM16xx
The Arduino TM16xx library supports LED & KEY and LED Matrix modules based on TM1638, TM1637, TM1640 as well as individual chips.
Simply use print() on 7-segment displays and use Adafruit GFX on matrix displays.

Adjusted for TM1650 by Maxint R&D, based on TM1637 code. 
Partially based on TM1640 library by MRicardo Batista. See ttps://github.com/rjbatista/tm1638-library
